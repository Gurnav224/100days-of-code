<h1>Re: Elieen Dover university application</h1>
<p>Dear Eileen, </p>

<p>Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part of your <abbr title="Doctor of philosphy">Phd</abbr> next year. I 
will answer your questions one by one , in the following sections. </p>

<h2>Starting dates </h2>
<p>we are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time. however it would suit us better if you could start at the begining of a semester, the start dates for each one are as follow: </p>

<ul>
<li>First Semester <time datetime="09-09-2016">9 September 2016</time></li>
<li>Second Semester <time datetime="15-01-2017">15 January 2017 </time></li>
<li>Third Semester <time datetime="02-05-2017">2 may 2017 </time></li>
</ul>

<p> Please let me know if this ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.</p>

<p>You can find more information about <a href="" >Important university dates</a>on our website.</p>

<h2>Subject of study </h2>
<p>At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open -minded research facility--as long as the subjects fall somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent , dedicated researchr, and just the kind of person we'd like to have on our team.Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued by are as follows, in order of priority: </p>

<ol>
<li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefit of Resveratrol(C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>).</p>
<li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30<sub>0</sub>c(86<sub>0</sub>F), when the audience size exponentially increase (effect of 3x10 <sup>3</sup> to 3x10<sup>4</sup>)</li>
<li><abbr title="Hypertext markup language>HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading style Sheet ">CSS</abbr>constructs for representing musical scores.</li>

<p>So please can you provide move information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the reasearch to take required staff and other resources. and anything else you think we'd need to know? thanks. </p>

</ul>

<h2>Exotic dance moves</h2>
<p>yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work . I <em>did</em> study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question,my favorite dances are as follows , with definitions:
</p>
<dl>
<dt>Polynesian chicken dance</dt>

<dd>A little know but <em>very</em>influential dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village would dance</dd>
<dd>in a circle like chickens , to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful". </p>
<dt>Icelandic brownian shuffle</dt>
<dd>Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which involved hudding close together in a circle on the floor. and shuffling their bodies around in impercerptibly tiny very rapid movements.One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired modern styles such as Twerking. </dd>
<dt>Arctic robot dance</dt>
<dd>An interesting example of historic misinformation. English exploers in the 1960s believed to have</dd>
<dd> discovered a new dance style characterised  by "robotic". stilled movements,being practiced by inhabitants </dd>
<dd> of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this </dd>
<dd>
because they really cold.</dd>

</dl>

<p>Yours sincerely </p>
